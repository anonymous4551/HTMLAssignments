        <center><h1><u>Rich Dad Poor Dad</u> <br><u>Robert Kiyosaki</u></h1></center>
        <p>The author compares his <b> <i>poor</i></b> dad to those people who are perpetually scampering in the Rat Race,
            helplessly trapped in a vicious cycle of needing more
            but never able to satisfy their dreams for wealth because of one <b><i>glaring</i></b> lack: financial literacy. 
            They spend so much time in school learning about the problems of the world, 
            but have not acquired any <b><i>valuable</i></b> lessons about money, 
            simply because it is never taught in school. His rich dad, 
            by contrast, represents the independently wealthy core of society 
            who deliberately takes advantage of the power of corporations and 
            their personal knowledge of tax and accounting (or that of their financial 
            advisers) which they manipulate to their advantage.</p>
